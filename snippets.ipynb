The building, a part of the Prudential Center complex, currently stands as the 2nd-tallest building in Boston, behind 200 Clarendon Street.   The Prudential Tower was designed by Charles Luckman and Associates for Prudential Insurance.   Completed in 1964, the building is 749 ft tall, with 52 floors.   It contains 1200000 sqft of commercial and retail space.   Including its radio mast, the tower stands as the tallest building in Boston and is tied with others as the 77th-tallest in the United States, rising to 907 ft in height.  Kirya Tower. Kirya Tower (also known as the HaYovel Tower) is a skyscraper in Tel Aviv, Israel.   At 158 m (42 floors), it is the sixth tallest building in Israel.   Construction was completed in 2005 on land previously belonging to the IDF HaKirya base.   The tower is located near the Tel Aviv\\'s tallest skyscraper cluster, the Azrieli Center complex, and is occupied largely by government offices.   The consolidation of many of these offices in the tower, which were previously spread out all over the Tel Aviv district, allowed the release of a considerable amount of high-value government land to private development, as well as introducing efficiencies from housing many government functions under one roof.   The tower has a helipad on its roof.   It was originally planned to have 28 floors for government functions only, with the additional 14 floors being approved during construction.   13 of these top floors were approved for use by private sector offices, and the top 11 floors have floor-to ceiling windows.   An external elevator serves the uppermost floors, and an underpass connects the building with the tower\\'s underground parking.   The rent being paid by the government is $16/square metre per month for the next 20 years.  The Shops at Prudential Center. The Shops at Prudential Center is an urban shopping center located at the base of the Prudential Tower in Boston, Massachusetts.
